# Introduction
Hand Cricket is a fun game that many of us played during our childhood. This Python version of Hand Cricket brings back those memories and allows you to play against the computer. The game follows the basic rules of hand cricket and is played in a command-line interface.

# Features
- Simple and interactive command-line interface
- Play against the computer
- Choose to bat or bowl
- Keeps track of scores and displays the winner

# Usage
To start the game, simply run the Python script:

# Rules
- The game starts with a toss to decide who bats and who bowls.
- If you bat, you will input a number between 1 and 6.
- The computer will also randomly choose a number between 1 and 6.
- If the numbers match, you are out.
- If the numbers don't match, the number you chose is added to your score.
- The same rules apply when the computer bats and you bowl.
- The player with the higher score at the end of the game wins.
